# ML vs Data Science vs AI Engineering

---

## Why This Comparison Matters

Many people feel confused about roles like:

- **Data Scientist**
- **Machine Learning Engineer**
- **AI Engineer**

> This confusion leads to:
> - Wrong expectations
> - Wrong learning paths
> - Frustration and wasted time

> **Let's make the differences clear.**

## The Data-to-Product Spectrum

Think of these roles as points on a spectrum:

```text
Data → Insight → Model → System → Product
  ↓       ↓        ↓        ↓        ↓
Analyst  Analyst  Scientist  MLEng   AIEng
```

> Each role focuses on a **different part** of this pipeline.

## Data Analyst

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Understanding historical data |
| **Typical Questions** | • What happened?<br>• Why did it happen?<br>• What trends exist? |
| **Outputs** | • Dashboards<br>• Reports<br>• SQL queries<br>• Business insights |

> Data analysts **rarely** build models.

---

## Data Scientist

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Experimentation and modeling |
| **Typical Questions** | • Can we predict this?<br>• Which features matter?<br>• Does this model improve performance? |
| **Outputs** | • Trained models<br>• Experiments<br>• Notebooks<br>• Metrics and analysis |

> Most data science work ends **before deployment**.

---

## Machine Learning Engineer

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Reliability and scalability of models |
| **Typical Questions** | • Will this model survive real data?<br>• How do we monitor it?<br>• How do we deploy and update it safely? |
| **Outputs** | • Deployed ML services<br>• Training pipelines<br>• Monitoring systems<br>• Production code |

> ML engineers care less about *trying models*  
> and more about *keeping them alive*.

---

## AI Engineer

| **Aspect** | **Details** |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Building usable AI-powered products |
| **Typical Questions** | • How does a user interact with this?<br>• How do we control cost and latency?<br>• How do we evaluate AI outputs? |
| **Outputs** | • AI applications<br>• RAG systems<br>• Agent workflows<br>• End-to-end user-facing systems |

> AI engineering became prominent with **foundation models**.

## A Simple Comparison Table

| **Role** | **Focus** | **Primary Output** |
|:---------|:----------|:-------------------|
| **Data Analyst** | Insight | Dashboards |
| **Data Scientist** | Models | Experiments |
| **ML Engineer** | Systems | Deployed models |
| **AI Engineer** | Products | AI applications |

> **No role is "better"** —  
> they just solve **different problems**.

## Where This Course Fits

> This course is **engineering-first**.

**We focus on:**
- Why models work
- Why models fail
- How systems behave in the real world
- Trade-offs, not tricks

**You will still learn:**
- Math
- Algorithms
- Deep learning

> But always through an **engineering lens**.

---

## A Critical Mindset Shift

### Beginner Mindset

> **If you only ask:**
> - "How do I train this model?"
>
> You are thinking like a **beginner**.

### Engineer Mindset

> **If you ask:**
> - "What breaks when this goes live?"
>
> You are thinking like an **engineer**.

> **This course trains the second mindset.**
